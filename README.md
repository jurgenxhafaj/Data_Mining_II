# Data_Mining_II
This repository contains my project using prediction models on soccer betting data.

Below is a table of contents with my project files and what they include:

Folder:		IMPORTANT FILES AND DATA

Main document with summary (aesthetically pleasing) --> Summary of my Project(no code).ipynb
Actual code used for every step ----------------------> DRAFT - present.ipynb
Summary of my models, Grid Search, etc----------------> accuracy percentages.xlsx
Presentation that was used in class-------------------> Predicting soccer scores for the sake of science.pptx

(original table was 266Mb and included tons of useless data so I removed a lot)
data containing results and bets --> edited match table.csv
data containing team strategies----> team_attributes.csv
data column explanations.txt -  pretty self explanatory

Folder:		OTHER FILES
References.txt - contains most of websites that I researched before/while doing the project
Other files include my tryouts to fit / validate / grid search models and other stuff.
