old results

when only taking into account the bets (not including the stage), 
I got the following results (with 3 fold cross validation)

amount of goals 53% accuracy
1x2 (W/D/L) 35-36% accuracy


Everything after this included the stage column and it was done with  
10 fold cross validation
