add a histogram to give an idea about
				 the data (total nr of goals in a game)



additional algorithms

gaussian Naive bayes unscaled + scaled

SVR

SVC


for optimization
SGD (similar to grid search)


PCA to find best features for your model
(also add 
the plot that looks like sqrt function so audience can easily spot it)



add a SUMMARY table AT THE TOP OF PROJECT 
	your methods and 
	treatments (PCA scaled& unscaled) AND 
	prediction %
